code from android course 2014

The code in this repository was used in the Fall 2014 version of the coures 420-518-DW Mobile Programming (Android).
The course was created for 3rd year students who have a substantial background in Java.  See http://www.dawsoncollege.qc.ca

The cobde is simplified an sometimes missing exceptions or other best coding practices in order to illustrate 
the Android components.  There are some places where using best coding practices would obscure the learning objective.

That being said I am responsible for any errors therein please contact me at pcampbell.dawson@gmail.com to report errors or omissions.
