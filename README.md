code from android course 2014

The code in this repository was used in the Fall 2014 version of the course 420-518-DW Mobile Programming (Android).
The course was created for 3rd year students who have a substantial background in Java.  See http://www.dawsoncollege.qc.ca

The code is simplified and sometimes missing the catching of exceptions or other best coding practices in order to illustrate the Android components.  There are some places where using best coding practices would obscure the learning objective.
